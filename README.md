# Health Worker Density in Australia

## Overview
This project analyzes the distribution of health workers across Australia using SQL and visualizes the findings with a Power BI dashboard. The analysis provides insights into workforce distribution, density patterns, and areas that may require policy attention or resource allocation.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on the number and types of health workers in Australia across different regions.  
- Source: [Data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au)  
- Format: CSV / Excel  
- Coverage period: 2014–2018

## Project Components

### 1. SQL Analysis
- SQL scripts used to extract, filter, and summarize health worker data.  
- Key queries include:  
  - Calculating health worker density by state/territory  
  - Aggregating workforce numbers by profession  
  - Identifying regions with the highest and lowest workforce coverage  

### 2. Power BI Dashboard
- Power BI `.pbix` file showcasing interactive visualizations including:  
  - Health worker density by region  
  - Comparison of workforce distribution across states  
  - Trend analysis and insights from the dataset  

### 3. Report
- PDF report summarizing:  
  - Data cleaning and preparation steps  
  - Methodology for SQL queries and visualization  
  - Key findings and actionable insights

## Key Findings
- Distribution of health professionals by type:  
  - Nurses and midwives: 53.69%  
  - Allied health professionals: 30.41%  
  - Medical practitioners: 15.9%  
- Urban (MMM) areas consistently had higher concentrations of health workers, showing significant imbalance.  
- From 2014 to 2018, the mean number of health professionals steadily increased, reflecting growth in workforce availability, likely due to increased investment in healthcare.  
- Unequal distribution between urban and remote areas poses challenges in healthcare access.  

---

## Limitations
- Possible data gaps or inconsistencies, which may not fully reflect current workforce distribution.  
- Focus on MMM and Remoteness Areas may overlook sub-regions with healthcare needs.  
- The study does not account for external factors (e.g., government policies, global events like COVID-19).  
- Data covers 2014–2018, which might not represent current trends.  

---

## Recommendations
- Implement policies to correct maldistribution, especially in rural and disadvantaged areas.  
- Offer incentives such as increased salary or relocation benefits to attract health workers.  
- Improve infrastructure and education/training programs in underserved regions.  
- Strengthen links between urban and rural health systems.  
- Regularly analyze workforce data to inform policy changes and maintain equitable healthcare access.  

---

## Challenges
- Data cleaning and preparation was complex due to null entries and duplicates.  
- Unequal distribution of medical personnel made interpretation difficult.  
- Visualization required careful variable selection and chart design for clear communication.  
- Interpretation needed understanding of regional healthcare disparities and policy implications.

## Conclusion
There is a clear inequality in the geographical distribution of health workers in Australia, with urban areas having higher workforce concentrations. Nurses and midwives make up the majority of the workforce. While the number of health workers increased from 2014–2018, targeted policies and incentives are required to attract and retain personnel in remote areas to ensure equitable access to healthcare.
